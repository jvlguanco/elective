                Composition
            </h2>

            <p className="mt-2 mb-4">
            The Board of Regents is a collegial body composed of seven (7) highly distinguished members, six (6) of whom are appointed by the Mayor of the city of Manila, with the consent of the then-Municipal Board, which is now the City Council of Manila. Of the six members appointed by the Mayor, the PLM Charter prescribes that one comes from the faculty, another is a distinguished alumnus, and one of the others from the field of education. The university regents are chosen on the basis of their professional competence. They are men of high and eminent integrity and distinguished professionals among the citizenry. The Division of City Schools (DCS) superintendent of Manila sits as an ex-officio member of the Board of Regents and becomes the 7th member of the Board.

                Term of Office
            </h2>

            <p className="mt-2 mb-4">
            Confirmed regential appointees automatically serve for a fixed term of six (6) years or until their successors shall have been appointed and qualified. They may therefore serve for more than 6 years on a hold-over capacity, provided no replacement shall have been qualified as of yet.<br/><br/>
            In case an incumbent regent cannot finish his term of six years by reason of resignation, death or other incapacities, the vacancy shall be filled by an appointment by the Mayor of the City of Manila, with the consent of the City Council, and the appointee shall hold office for the unexpired portion of the term, instead of the fixed term of six (6) years.
