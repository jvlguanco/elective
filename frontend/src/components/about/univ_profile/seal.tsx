            </h2>

            <p className="mt-4 mb-12">
            The Academic Collar, which bears the seal of the PLM as its gold pendant, is the first symbol bequeathed to the president during the investiture rites. By wearing it, President Leyco has accepted to carry on his shoulder the academic leadership necessary to fulfill PLMâ€™s mission and vision.

            <h2 className="font-inter font-semibold text-[24px] text-navy-blue">
                Mace
            </h2>

            <p className="mt-4 mb-12">
            The Mace symbolizes the authority of the president, the source of his power to administer the university. <br/><br/>

            It was presented first to Dr. Benito F. Reyes, the first PLM president, by then-Mayor Antonio J. Villegas on February 10, 1968. It has been recently turned over by the Chairperson to current President.
